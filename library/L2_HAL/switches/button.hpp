  /// How it works:
  /// When called, this method checks what the previous state of the gpio signal
  /// was compared to right now. If the state of the button was HIGH previously
  /// and is now LOW, that means that a user's finger was previously pressing on
  /// the button, and has since released the button. This is also know as a
  /// falling edge signal.
  ///
  /// Usage:
  /// In order for this to work, the Released() method needs to be called
  /// periodically to check that the state of the pin has changed. If it is not
  /// called fast enough, it may miss a transition of the signal from HIGH to
  /// LOW.
