/// Module is the basis interface for all other SJSU-Dev2 interfaces. It
/// incorporates an API for initialization and setup as well as a state to know
/// which stage the module is in.
///
/// The module usage flow:
///
///  State: kReset
///     All modules start off with state kReset. At this point the only method
///     that should be called is Initialize(). Calling any other method is
///     undefined behavior. The work of Initialize() must NOT be done in the
///     constructor of a Module derived class as the order of initialization is
///     not deterministic and can also result in undefined behavior.
///
///  State: kInitialized
///     When Initialize() is called, the state of the module is transitioned to
///     kInitialized, if, and only if, the state of the module is in kReset
///     beforehand. Otherwise, no work is done by Initialize(). This allows
///     Initialize() to be called multiple times without performing the same
///     task multiple times. This is helpful when a module is used by two or
///     more other modules and both modules call Initialize().
///
///     After Initialize() has been executed without an exception being thrown,
///     the module can now be configured. SJSU-Dev2 convention for derived
///     modules APIs is to name methods that configure a system with the name
///     ConfigureX(), where X can be ClockRate, MaxRange, Frequency, etc. For
///     example, at this stage one can run ConfigureBaudRate(9600) on the Uart
///     driver. Only the Configuration methods shall be called at this stage.
///
/// State: kEnabled
///    Once the module has been appropriately configured for the usage of the
///    application. The module can be Enabled(). Once enabled, the module can
///    use the runtime usage method. These methods can be identified as they are
///    the methods of an API that does not have the "Configure-" prefix. These
///    usage APIs interact with hardware, such as SetDutyCycle() in the Pwm
///    driver or Transfer() for the SPI class. Configuration methods should not
///    be called when in this state. Doing so is undefined behavior.
///
/// State: kDisabled
///    In the event the Configuration options need to be change, the module must
///    first be disabled by running the Enabled(false) method with the input
///    parameter false. This will disable the module and allow usage of the
///    Configuration() methods. Using the Configuration() methods outside of the
///    kInitialized and kDisabled state is undefined behavior.
///
/// State: kCritical
///    If a module attempted to perform some task and it was unable to in an
///    exceptional way, the module will set its state to kCritical using the
///    SetState() method provided to all Modules. This indicates that the module
///    can no longer be used as normal. The only way out of this would be for
///    the system to call SetState() force the state back to kReset, and run
///    through the initialization sequence again. As a means to recover, a
///    system may consider changing the Configuration settings if these led to
///    the exception being called. Another alternative would be to run exit and
///    reset the system.
///
/// These rules of usage must be followed for proper operation by all module
/// within SJSU-Dev2 as well as external modules using the SJSU-Dev2 modules.

  /// the lpc40xx driver will set its duty cycle to 0% when disabled. The
  /// disable/enable transition information should be documented for the
  /// specific driver if it has an significant change to the state. For example
  /// most GPIOs do not change state when disabled, and thus may have a comment

  ///
  /// "Transitions from enabled to disabled have no effect on the output signal"

  ///
  ///   Step 1) If applicable, if the configuration settings were stored within
  ///           the module's memory and not stored within the memory of the
  ///           device itself, then it is the job of Enable() to write the
  ///           configuration information to the device.
  ///           THIS STEP IS AN EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE.
  ///           Always, refrain from caching configuration information if it can
  ///           be stored in the device's memory directly, such that enable can
  ///           reduce the work it needs to perform.

  ///   Step 2) Run any procedures required to enable this module for usage.
