/// Abstract interface for a platform's System Controller.
///
/// A System controller manages a platform's:
///     - Clocks and their speeds
///     - PLLs feeding into the system's clocks
///     - Peripheral and system resource power systems
///
/// The System controller also gives information about the system such as what
/// speed a clock is running at so that their peripheral drivers can calculate
/// things such as the clock rates for serial communicate or the clock cycles
/// before an event or interrupt is planned to occur.
///
/// Every SystemController should take a custom ClockConfiguration data
/// structure reference as an input in their constructor, unless a system does
/// not incorporate any form of clock tree.
///
/// A simplified example of a basic ClockConfiguration data structure. Notice
/// that man of the elements within the structure are enumerations to make them
/// readable:
///
///     struct ClockConfiguration
///     {
///       Oscillator oscillator = Oscillator::kIrc;
///       ClockDividers peripheral_divider = ClockDividers::kDivideBy1;
///       ClockDividers cpu_divider = ClockDividers::kDivideBy1;
///       // ...
///     };
///
